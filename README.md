# Constructing PCA Indexes

Welcome to the Constructing PCA Indexes repository! This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide and implementation of PCA indexes that replicate major global indexes. 

## Introduction
PCA indexes are widely used in finance and investment management to replicate the performance of major global indexes. By constructing PCA indexes, investors can gain exposure to a diversified portfolio that closely tracks the movements of these indexes. This repository aims to provide a step-by-step guide and code examples to help you understand and implement PCA indexes.

## Usage
The repository provides several Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the construction of PCA indexes.  
Feel free to explore the code and modify it according to your requirements. You can also use the provided example as a starting point for your own PCA index construction.
